{"name":"Magstripe attendance","tagline":"","body":"Magstripe Attendance Database\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n#### Owen Phillips (ophilli@clemson.edu)\r\n#### Shane Tully (shane@shanetully.com)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis is a Python 3.x program depending on the following additional libraries \r\n   1. `PyQt` - Python bindings for QT \r\n   1. `psycopg2` - Python Postgres library\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nThis program requires a database server (remote or local), that is configurable in 'Constants.py' or may be selected during login.\r\n\r\nFor the database, this application expects two tables - users & checkIns\r\n\r\nSetup the users table with 3 columns: \r\n   1. card ID        - card ID from ID card (`varchar`, `primary key`) \r\n   1. user ID        - university username (`varchar`) \r\n   1. visits         - the number of check-ins (`int`)\r\n   \r\nSetup the checkIns table with 2 columns: \r\n   1. card ID \r\n   1. checkIn  - the time of last check-in (`timestamp`)\r\n   \r\nThis application was built for a card reader that uses keyboard emulation. You can type the card info in, but a card reader is suggested.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nSimply run \"./Check-in.py\" to start the GUI. \r\n\r\nThere is also a text-only mode. This can be started by using the \"--nogui\" argument.\r\nIn text mode, enter \"back\" at any time to go up a menu level or exit the check-in loop.\r\n\r\nTo populate your database, select the check-in option and begin adding users.\r\n\r\nAfter your database is populated you can use the \"Show Points\" option to show a single user's points or view a pretty table of all users in descending order from most to least points.\r\n\r\nBy default a card is only allowed to check-in once per hour to prevent abuse.  This can be modified by changing the value of `ALLOW_CHECKIN_WITHIN_HOUR`  in `Constants.py`.\r\n\r\n### Packaging\r\n\r\nA PyInstaller .spec file is provided to package the program and all  dependencies into a single binary file for Linux, Windows, or Mac.\r\n\r\nTo create this binary, download PyInstaller and run `make.py dist [path to pyinstaller]`. The resulting binary will be in the `dist` directory. \r\nAlternatively, precompiled binaries are available on the releases page on the GitHub repo.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify \r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by \r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or \r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, \r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of \r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
